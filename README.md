# üïπÔ∏è Cornell McRay t'Racing

## Building

Sync to the same parent directory that `kajiya` is in, so that the folder structure becomes:

```
kajiya/
kajiya/assets
(...)
cornell-mcray/
(...)
```

Build the `bake` bin in the `kajiya` folder:

```
cd kajiya
cargo build --release -p bake
```

Bake the meshes for `cornell-mcray`:

```
bake.cmd
```

## Running

Make sure `dxcompiler.dll` is in the executable environment. You can grab it from `kajiya` and copy into `cornell-mcray`, or stash it somewhere in `PATH`

Then run:

```
cargo run --release
```

## Controls

* WSAD - driving
* Shift - nitro
* B - spawn a box ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Q - party mode üéä
